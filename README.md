# aDDM_Simulation_Attempt_1
Simulation of aDDM data to figure out whether different variations of the model can capture both, the overall value effect and the value difference effect (not looking very promising atm). Adapted and modified from aDDM simulations introduced by Krajbich et al. (2011). For the study: Experiential Neglect Nr 2
